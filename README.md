# COVID-19 Analysis in India ðŸ¦ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

Welcome to the COVID-19 Analysis in India repository! This project focuses on analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic in India using data visualization and insights. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive view of the situation, leveraging Tableau for interactive data visualization.

## Tableau Dashboards
We have created a series of Tableau dashboards that offer in-depth insights into the COVID-19 situation in India:

- **Comprehensive Data Visualization:** Explore daily case counts, testing rates, vaccination progress, and regional hotspots.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Discover infection clusters and regional patterns using interactive maps.
- **Temporal Trends:** Analyze how the virus has evolved over time in various states and regions.
- **Detailed Data Exploration:** Dive into granular data, including age-wise distribution, gender disparities, and more.

## Key Insights
Here are some key insights from our analysis:

- **Uttar Pradesh:** This state has witnessed a higher number of COVID-19 positive cases, indicating the need for enhanced monitoring and prevention efforts.

- **Maharashtra:** Tragically, this state has experienced a higher number of COVID-19-related fatalities. This underscores the importance of focusing efforts on healthcare infrastructure and prevention strategies in this region.

## Data Sources
We rely on authoritative sources for our data, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Please find the data sources in the project's documentation.

## Live Data Updates
The project includes live data feeds to ensure that the information remains current and pertinent.
